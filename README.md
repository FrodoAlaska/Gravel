# What Is Gravel?  
A minimalist game framework built with GLFW and OpenGL. Brought to you by C++. 
The aim of Gravel is not to build a game engine capabale of doing what Unity or Unreal can. Rather, it is a foundational structure of which a lot of my future games and projects will be built upon. It is essentially a _game framework_ more than it is a _game engine_.
