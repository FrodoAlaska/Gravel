# TODO:
- Add meshes as resources
- Materials? 
- Load models 

# LATER TODO:
- Model animations
- Minimal logger
- Some kind of arena allocater

# FIX: 
- Mouse position stuff - perhaps you'll need to change it into the projection matrix when moving the camera
- Texts get fucked with long strings for some reason
