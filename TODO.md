# TODO:
- Make instancing better
- Add materials to the resource manager
- Load models 

# LATER TODO:
- Model animations
- Minimal logger
- Some kind of arena allocater

# FIX: 
- Mouse position stuff - perhaps you'll need to change it into the projection matrix when moving the camera
- The 2D renderer and 3D renderer don't work so well together
- Texts get fucked with long strings for some reason - maybe reaching the texture limit?
