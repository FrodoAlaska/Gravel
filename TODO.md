# TODO:
- Cubemaps
- Make the framework into an actual library oooooor make it easier to copy and paste directly into other projects

# LATER TODO:
- The 2D renderer needs a whole rewrite. Perhaps a 'begin_vertex' and 'end_vertex' functions so I don't have to redo the whole thing again??
- Model animations
- Minimal logger and asserts
- Some kind of arena allocater
- Simple scene system?

# FIX:
- TEMP FIX: Button texts positions are wrong on different font sizes 
- Texts get fucked with long strings for some reason - maybe reaching the texture limit?
